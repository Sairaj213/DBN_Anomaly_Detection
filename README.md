# üö® DBN-Based Time-Series Anomaly Detection
<br> 
This project implements an unsupervised anomaly detection system using Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) built from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). It is designed to detect abnormal patterns in 1D time-series data, especially when labeled anomalies are unavailable.

<br>
The core idea is simple but powerful:

<br>

- Train a DBN on normal patterns.

- Use *reconstruction error* to identify anomalies ‚Äî since unusual patterns are poorly reconstructed by a model trained on normal data.
<br>

## Project Definition
<br>

- Synthetic or Real Data: Use pre-generated signals or plug in your own CSV time-series.

- RBM Stack (DBN): Layer-wise training with Contrastive Divergence.

- Unsupervised Learning: No labels or prior anomaly definitions needed.

- Thresholding: Uses 90th percentile of reconstruction error as an anomaly cutoff.

- Visual Diagnostics: Built-in plots for errors and reconstructions.

## Project Flow
<br>

1. **Data Preparation**

   * Load or generate a 1D time-series dataset.
   * If synthetic, anomalies are injected to simulate real-world faults.
   * The data is normalized and split into overlapping windows (sequences).

2. **Model Training**

   * A Deep Belief Network (DBN) is trained in an unsupervised manner.
   * The DBN consists of stacked RBMs, each learning to compress and reconstruct the input patterns.

3. **Reconstruction and Error Computation**

   * Each input sequence is passed through the trained model and reconstructed.
   * Reconstruction error is calculated for every sequence (e.g., using mean squared error).

4. **Anomaly Detection**

   * A statistical threshold (e.g., 90th percentile of error) is used to flag sequences with high reconstruction error as anomalies.

5. **Visualization**

   * Plots are generated to show:

     * Sample time-series with anomalies.
     * Distribution of reconstruction errors.
     * Original vs reconstructed sequences for anomalous samples.

git clone https://github.com/Sairaj213/DBN_Anomaly_Detection.git
cd DBN_Anomaly_Detection
```

---

#### 2. **Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

#### 4. **Use Your Own CSV Time-Series**

To use your own data:

1. Open `main.py`
2. Scroll to the section marked:

   ```
   #  SECTION 1: CHOOSE DATA SOURCE
   ```
3. **Comment out** the lines:

```python
normal_data = generate_normal_series(...)
anomalous_data = inject_anomalies(...)
```

4. **Uncomment** the block:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")
series = df['value'].values
...
```

5. Replace:

   * `"your_data.csv"` with the path to your CSV file.
   * `'value'` with the correct column name from your file.

---

#### 5. **Important Notes**

*  **Close Each Plot Window**
  The program pauses after each plot (`plt.show()`). Close the window to continue.

*  **Anomaly Detection Threshold**
  Uses the 90th percentile of reconstruction errors. Adjustable in `main.py`.

*  **Sequence Length**
  Default is 100. Can be changed in `create_sequences()`.
